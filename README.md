# Splitter
Smart contract named `Splitter` whereby:

* there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol
* we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the web page
* whenever Alice sends ether to the contract, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol
* we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the web page
* we can send ether to it from the web page

Stretch goals:

* add a kill switch to the whole contract
* make the contract a utility that can be used by David, Emma and anybody with an address to split Ether between any 2 other addresses of their own choice
* cover potentially bad input data
